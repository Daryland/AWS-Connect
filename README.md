AWS Connect vanity number project 

Deliverables

1.           Git Repo with all code and documentation

1.           BONUS - a working Amazon Connect phone number to test in your environment

Exercise

1.           Create a Lambda that converts phone numbers to vanity numbers and save the best 5 resulting vanity numbers and the caller's number in a DynamoDB table. "Best" is defined as you see fit - explain your thoughts.

2.           Create an Amazon Connect contact flow that looks at the caller's phone number and says the 3 vanity possibilities that come back from the Lambda function.
